I have a lot of hobbies that I like to do like drawing, editing and cooking. I like to editing, sometimes when I have a lot of free time I like to mae a little animation. I like to make art specially when I draw sme objects because it's really easy to draw objects because I can look to the objects and make the drawing look realistic. I like cooking because I always helped my mom in the kitchen and it's really fun. Ireally like</p>
